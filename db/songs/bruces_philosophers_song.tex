\begin{songtext}
Immanuel Kant was a real pissant
who was very rarely stable.
Heidegger, Heidegger was boozy beggar
who could think you under the table.
David Hume could out-consume
Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,
and Wittgenstein was a beery swine
who was just as schloshed as Schlegel.

There's nothing Nietzsche couldn't teach ya
'bout the raising of the wrist.
Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed.

John Stuart Mill, of his own free will,
on half a pint of shandy was particularly ill.
Plato, they say, could stick it away,
half a crate of whisky every day.
Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle.
Hobbes was fond of his dram,
and René Descartes was a drunken fart,
\textquotedblleft{}I drink, therefore I am.\textquotedblright{}
\newpage
Yes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missed.
A lovely little thinker, but a bugger when he's pissed!

\begin{songnotes}
Martin Heidegger var den enda av de nämnda filosoferna som ännu var i livet när sången skrevs. Han dog 1976, 86 år gammal.
